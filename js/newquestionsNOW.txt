Absolutely! Based on a comprehensive analysis of both your **existing question bank** (`questionstext.txt`) and the **Final Review content** (`final review text form.txt`), I’ve identified several underrepresented or partially covered topics. I’ve generated **50 new, non-repeating, high-yield questions** that align with the Final Review’s depth and style.
