Chapter 25: Diseases of the Digestive System

Slide 1: Structure and Function

    Text:

        The human digestive system.

        Key components: Oral Cavity, Tongue, Teeth, Parotid (salivary) gland, Pharynx, Esophagus, Stomach, Liver, Gallbladder, Duodenum, Pancreas, Small intestine, Large intestine, Rectum, Anus.

        Normal Microbiota:

            Stomach and small intestine have few microorganisms due to HCl and rapid movement of food.

            Large intestine has enormous microbial population (mostly anaerobes and facultative anaerobes).

    [Image Description]: A medical illustration of the human upper body showing the digestive tract from mouth to anus, labeling all major organs involved in digestion.

Slide 2: Normal Microbiota & Diarrheal Disease Intro

    Text:

        Large intestine: >100 billion bacteria per gram of feces. mostly anaerobes and facultative anaerobes.

        Diarrheal Disease:

            Acute syndrome of the intestinal tract.

            Volume, fluid content, and frequency of bowel movements increase.

            Usually a symptom of gastroenteritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach and intestine).

        Infectious diarrhea has two basic mechanisms: Toxigenic and Invasive.

    [Image Description]: A diagram comparing a healthy intestinal wall to one with "Over-secretion of fluids" caused by bacteria.

Slide 3: Toxigenic vs. Invasive Diarrhea

    Text:

        Toxigenic:

            Bacteria release enterotoxins.

            Bind surface receptors on small intestine.

            Disrupts physiology of epithelial cells.

            Stimulates hypersecretions of fluids and electrolytes.

            Organism does not invade tissues.

            Large volume; No blood in stool.

        Invasive:

            Microbes invade the wall of the small or large intestine.

            Damages cells that line mucosa.

            Blood in stool.

            Results in severe dehydration.

            40% of worldwide infectious disease; 18% of deaths worldwide.

    [Image Description]: Two diagrams. (a) Toxigenic: Bacteria sit on the surface, toxins enter cells causing fluid secretion. (b) Invasive: Bacteria physically penetrate the intestinal epithelium, causing damage and bleeding.

Slide 4: Staphylococcus aureus (Toxigenic)

    Text:

        Food poisoning: Due to enterotoxins.

        Transmission: Contact with food workers who carry it.

        Associated with: Contaminated custards, sauces, processed meats, sandwiches, chicken salad left unrefrigerated.

        Enterotoxins are heat stable:

            A superantigen.

            Stimulates nerves causing cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

            Recovery in 24 hours.

    [Image Description]: An image of a "Lunch Lady" action figure and a tray of cafeteria food.

Slide 5: Staph. aureus Characteristics

    Text:

        Staphylococci: Common skin/mucous membrane inhabitant. Spherical cells, irregular clusters. Lack spores, flagella. May be encapsulated.

        S. aureus:

            Most serious of staph pathogens.

            Large number of nosocomial infections.

            Facultative anaerobe.

            Very resistant non-spore forming pathogen.

            Can withstand: High salt (7-10%), Extremes in pH, High temps.

            Remains viable after months of air drying.

    [Image Description]: Left: A Gram stain showing purple clusters of cocci bacteria. Right: A Scanning Electron Micrograph (SEM) of Staph clusters. Bottom: Cartoon of Homer Simpson dressed as the Grim Reaper.

Slide 6: S. aureus Virulence

    Text:

        Virulence factors include enzymes and toxins.

        Coagulase: Causes fibrin to be deposited around cells. Inhibits phagocytosis. Allows staph to adhere to tissues. Enzyme present in 97% of all human isolates.

        Penicillinase.

        Methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA).

        Hemolysins.

Slide 7: S. aureus Pathogenesis & Shigella Intro

    Text:

        S. aureus:

            25-30% of population has it colonized in nose (also skin, nasopharynx, intestine).

            Colonization of infants can occur at birth.

            Most infections are minor (pimples, boils). Some are serious (surgical wound infections, bloodstream infections).

        Shigella Background:

            Discovered 100 years ago by Kiyoshi Shiga.

            Facultative anaerobe, gram negative.

            4 sub-species:

                S. sonnei: Most common in US (72%).

                S. flexneri: (28%), predominant in developing countries.

                S. dysenteriae: Causes most severe shigellosis, Eastern Hemisphere.

                S. boydii.

Slide 8: Shigellosis (Bacillary Dysentery)

    Text:

        Incapacitating dysentery, abdominal cramps.

        Watery, mucous, bloody stool.

        Primarily a pediatric disease (70% of cases in children under 15, mostly not toilet trained).

        Transmission: Fecal-oral. Spread only person-to-person.

        Infectious dose is low: 10-200 cells.

    [Image Description]: A stock photo of a scenic waterfall (visual metaphor for watery stool).

Slide 9: Shigellosis Pathogenesis

    Text:

        Shigella ingested (not affected by stomach HCl).

        Invades villus cells of small intestine.

        Triggers phagocytosis.

        Replicates inside intestinal cells.

        Shigella is non-motile but invades neighboring cells (avoiding immune system).

        Shiga toxin destroys tissue.

        Does not perforate intestine or invade blood.

    [Image Description]: A step-by-step diagram showing Shigella entering an epithelial cell, multiplying, moving to neighboring cells, and causing a mucosal abscess.

Slide 10: Shigella Virulence Factor

    Text:

        S. dysenteriae: Most virulent species.

        Produces Shiga Toxin exotoxin.

        Binds intestinal and renal cells and kills them.

        Results in decreased absorption in large intestine, fluid loss, renal failure.

        Dysentery results from damage to intestinal cell wall.

        E. coli O157:H7 produces similar toxin.

    [Image Description]: Two images of the Taco Bell Chihuahua. One says "¡No Quiero Taco Bell!" and the other shows the dog sitting on a toilet with the text "NO MORE."

Slide 11: Salmonella Intro

    Text:

        Gram negative, facultative anaerobe.

        Invade and multiply in intestinal mucosa. Can enter blood.

        Nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea.

        Death rate low (1%), higher in infants/elderly (septic shock).

        Antibiotics not useful; Oral rehydration therapy used.

        Two diseases: Typhoid fever and Salmonellosis.

        Pathogenesis: Enter M cells, multiply in vesicles, inflammatory response causes diarrhea. Bacteria may cross into lymphatic system/bloodstream.

    [Image Description]: Diagram showing Salmonella bacteria entering M cells in the intestinal tract, multiplying, and entering the bloodstream/lymph nodes.

Slide 12: Typhoid Fever

    Text:

        Causative agent: Salmonella typhi.

        Humans are exclusive host. Carried in blood and intestinal tract.

        Obtained fecal-orally.

        ~400 cases/year in US (70% acquired traveling abroad: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan).

        Worldwide: 21.5 million cases/year, 25,000 deaths.

        Infection: Organisms carried systemically (liver, spleen, gallbladder).

        Small percentage carry S. typhi in gallbladder (chronic carriers).

        Symptoms: 103-104°F fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Ulcers/Perforations possible.

    [Image Description]: A medical illustration showing the spread of Typhoid bacilli through the digestive tract into the blood vessels.

Slide 13: Typhoid Fever Treatment

    Text:

        Vaccine available.

        Antibiotics: Ampicillin, Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, Ciprofloxacin.

        Deaths rarely occur with treatment.

        Without treatment: Fever for weeks, 20% mortality from complications.

Slide 14: Typhoid Mary & Salmonellosis

    Text:

        Typhoid Mary: Mary Mallon, NYC cook. 1st healthy carrier identified in US. Infected 47 people. Refused to stop working; died in quarantine.

            If untreated, death in <48 hours.

            Affects millions in Africa and Asia.

    [Image Description]: Top: Graphics of food (eggs, cake, meat). Bottom: SEM image of Vibrio bacteria (comma-shaped).

Slide 17: Cholera Pathogenesis

    Text:

        Ingested with food or water. Spread in areas with poor sewage. Also raw/undercooked shellfish (Gulf of Mexico).

        Cells penetrate mucous barrier, rest on epithelial cells (do not invade).

        Enterotoxin (Cholera Toxin - CT): Disrupts physiology. Activates Adenyl cyclase -> cAMP -> Electrolytes pumped out -> Profuse water loss (1L/hour).

    [Image Description]: Cartoon of Speedy Gonzales (referencing "fast" progression).

Slide 18: Cholera Pathogenesis (Continued)

    Text:

        In children and compromised individuals.

        Escherichia coli:

            Most prevalent enteric bacillus.

            Enterotoxigenic E. coli causes severe diarrhea (70% of traveler's diarrhea).

            Two exotoxins: Heat labile (LT) and Heat stable (ST). Stimulate secretion/fluid loss.

    [Image Description]: Top: Movie poster "Love in the Time of Cholera". Bottom: A scene from the movie "Slumdog Millionaire" (referencing location of outbreaks).

Slide 20: E. coli (Infantile & Food Infections)

        Food Infections (O157:H7):

            Most infamous. Leads to intestinal hemorrhaging.

            Virulence due to cell wall receptor fusing with host cell (direct port to secrete toxins).

            Shiga-like toxin: Binds ribosomes, disrupts translation, kills intestinal cells.

    [Image Description]: Top: Cartoon of a crying baby. Middle: Chart of causes of death in children. Bottom: Collage of the Taco Bell dog (RIP Gidget), Jack in the Box mascot, and Popeye (spinach contamination reference).

        Long term: Associated with gastric cancer (6th most common cancer).

        Lifelong infection: Colonizes stomach in ~50% of humans. Contracted in early childhood. Most asymptomatic, but 0-15% get ulcers, small % get cancer.

    [Image Description]: Left: Person wearing a shirt saying "don't eat poop". Right: Infographic showing genetic variation among humans and bacteria regarding susceptibility.

Slide 25: H. pylori Pathogenesis & Diagnosis

    Text:

        H. pylori is NOT an acidophile.

        Ulcer development:

            Colonizes stomach.

            Uses flagella to pass mucus layer & attach to epithelial cells.

            Produces urease (neutralizes acid).

            Loss of mucus coating predisposes to gastritis.

            Immune response/inflammation damages mucosa.

        Diagnosis: Blood test (Abs), Urea Breath Test (labeled urea), Endoscopy.
