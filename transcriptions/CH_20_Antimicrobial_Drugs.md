# Chapter 20: Antimicrobial Drugs

## Slide 1: Drug Resistance
- Adaptive response where cells tolerate an amount of drug
  - that would normally be inhibitory
- Bacterial populations have high genetic versatility and adaptability.

**Image: Cartoon showing two bacteria in an alley, one in a trenchcoat saying "Pssst! Hey kid! Wanna be a Superbug...? Stick some of this into your genome... Even penicillin won't be able to harm you..!" Caption: "It was on a short-cut through the hospital kitchens that Albert was first approached by a member of the Antibiotic Resistance."**

## Slide 2: The Spectrum of Antimicrobial Activity
- Narrow spectrum
  - Effective on small range of microbes
  - Targets a specific cell component
  - Found only in certain microbes
- Broad spectrum
  - Targets cell components common to most pathogens.

## Slide 3: Natural Selection and Drug Resistance
- Large populations has some cells that are already drug resistant
  - Due to prior mutations/transfers
- These stay low in number
- No survival advantage
- But upon exposure to drug
  - Resistant cells proliferate
- Offspring inherit this resistance.

**Figure: Three petri dishes showing (a) Population of microbial cells with drug-resistant mutants, (b) Sensitive cells eliminated by drug, resistant mutants survive (Early/Late), (c) All cells are now resistant - showing Exposure to drug → Remaining population grows over time**

## Slide 4: Mechanisms of Resistance
- Enzymatic destruction or inactivation
  - β-lactamase
- Blocking entry to target site
  - Gram negative cells generally more resistant
    - Restricts absorption through porins
- Alteration of drug's target site
- Rapid efflux of antibiotic.

## Slide 5: Antivirals

Inhibition of Nucleic Acid Synthesis (Acyclovir, Nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors)**

## Slide 6: Objective of Antimicrobials
- Naturally,
  - Antibiotic producers enjoy less competition
- Synthetic considerations
  - Easy administration of drug
  - Eliminate infection
    - Without harming host
  - Selectively toxic.

## Slide 7: Affecting Metabolic Pathways
- Competitive inhibitors of enzymes
- Many are synthetic
  - Sulfonamides (sulfa drugs)
  - Trimethoprim
    - Both block folic acid synthesis
    - A precursor to DNA/RNA
    - Often given simultaneously
- Synergy
  - Effects of combo of antibiotics is greater than the sum of the effects of the individual antibiotics.

## Slide 8: Antiviral Drugs
- Viruses depend on host for metabolism
- Disrupting viral metabolism can have an affect on host
- Selective toxicity is difficult to achieve
- Designed to block a step in completing viral life cycle.
- Modes of Action
  - Nucleotide analogs

## Slide 11: Inhibiting Bacterial Cell Wall Synthesis
- Cephalosporin
  - Works like penicillin
  - Its β-lactam ring is more resistant to β-lactamases
  - More effective against gram negative.
