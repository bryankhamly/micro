Energy source branches into:
- Chemical → Chemotrophs → Carbon source
  - Organic compounds → Chemoheterotrophs → Final electron acceptor
    - O₂ → All animals, most fungi, protozoa, bacteria
    - Not O₂ → Organic compound (Fermentative Streptococcus, for example) or Inorganic compound (Electron transport chain Clostridium, for example)
  - CO₂ → Chemoautotrophs → Hydrogen-, sulfur-, iron-, nitrogen-, and carbon monoxide-oxidizing bacteria
- Light → Phototrophs → Carbon source
  - Organic compounds → Photoheterotrophs → Green nonsulfur bacteria, purple nonsulfur bacteria
  - CO₂ → Photoautotrophs → Use H₂O to reduce CO₂?
    - Yes → Oxygenic photosynthesis (plants, algae, cyanobacteria)
    - No → Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria (green and purple bacteria)

**Phototrophs** – use light as primary source of energy

**Chemotrophs** – depend on oxidation-reduction (redox) rxns of organic and inorganic compounds for energy.
