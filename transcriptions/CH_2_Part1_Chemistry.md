### Slide 1: Bonds and Molecules

- Molecule
  - distinct chemical substance that results from the combination of two or more atoms
- Compound
  - molecules that are combinations of 2 or more *different* elements
  - Ex. Water
- Chemical bond
  - when 2 or more atoms share, donate or accept electrons to form molecules and compounds
  - 3 types: covalent, ionic, and hydrogen.

### Slide 3: Hydrogen Bonds

- H atom covalently bonded to one O or N atom is attracted to another O or N
- By itself, very weak
  - but many together are strong.

[Figure: (b) Multiple water molecules showing hydrogen bonding between them]

### Slide 4: The Octet Rule

- The outermost shell determines the atom's reactivity
- 8 e⁻ = happy
- Atoms can give, take, or share electrons to get 8
- If 3 or less, tendency to donate
- If 5 or more, tendency to receive
- The outermost electrons are called valence electrons..

### Slide 5: Peptide bonds...

- Covalent bond between 2 amino acids
- Polypeptide
  - Chain of amino acids.

### Slide 6: Atomic Structure

- Matter
  - all materials that occupy space and have mass
  - Matter is composed of atoms
- Atom
  - Smallest component of a pure substance
  - Cannot be subdivided into smaller substances without losing its properties
  - composed of protons, neutrons, and electrons
- Element
  - Fundamental substance composed of atoms that have the same number of protons
  - And behaves the same way chemically.

### Slide 8: Electrons and Energy

- Usually, in atoms, #electrons = #protons
- What does this do to the overall charge?
- So where are the electrons (e⁻)?
  - They are attracted to the positive nucleus
  - Revolve around the nucleus in orbitals at particular energy levels (electron shells).

[Figure: Atomic diagrams showing electron configurations for:
- hydrogen ¹H (1 electron)
- carbon ¹²C (6 electrons)
- nitrogen ¹⁴N (7 electrons)
- oxygen ¹⁶O (8 electrons)
- phosphorus ³¹P (15 electrons)
- sulfur ³²S (16 electrons)]

### Slide 10: Electron Configuration

- Each shell has 2 or more e⁻
- The first shell has up to 2 e⁻
- Each shell after has up to 8 e⁻
  - The Octet Rule..
