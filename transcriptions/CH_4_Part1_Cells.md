[Handwritten: veg. cell]

[Figure: (a) Sporulation, the process of endospore formation:
1. Spore septum begins to isolate newly replicated DNA and a small portion of cytoplasm. (Cell wall, Cytoplasm, Plasma membrane, Bacterial chromosome (DNA))
2. Plasma membrane starts to surround DNA, cytoplasm, and membrane isolated in step 1.
3. Spore septum surrounds isolated portion, forming forespore. (Two membranes)
4. Peptidoglycan layer forms between membranes.
5. Spore coat forms.
6. Endospore is freed from cell.]
