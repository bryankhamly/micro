# Chapter 13: Viruses, Viroids, and Prions (Part 2)

## Slide 1: Animal Viruses
- Biosynthesis of DNA viruses
  - Viral DNA released into nucleus
  - Transcription/translation of "early" genes
    - Products of these genes are enzymes required for viral multiplication
  - Then "late" genes expressed
    - Capsid and other structural proteins
  - Capsid migrates to nucleus
  - Virus assembled
  - Release of mature virion.

3. PrP^Sc reacts with PrP^c on the cell surface.
4. PrP^Sc converts the PrP^c to PrP^Sc.
5. The new PrP^Sc converts more PrP^c.
6. The new PrP^Sc is taken in, possibly by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
