### Slide 1: The Endosymbiotic Theory

- Prokaryotic cells
  - 3.5 BYA
- Eukaryotic cells
  - 2.5 BYA
- Larger bacterial cells lost cell wall
  - And engulfed smaller bacterial cells
- Smaller cell lives and reproduces inside
  - Becomes specialized
    - Oxygen utilization
    - Photosynthesis
- Evolves into obligatory relationship.

### Slide 14: Movement of Materials across Membranes

[Handwritten: ↓[solute]]

[Figure: (c) Isotonic solution. No net movement of water occurs. (Cytoplasm, Solute, Plasma membrane, Water)]
[Figure: (d) Hypotonic solution. Water moves into the cell. If the cell wall is strong, it contains the swelling. If the cell wall is weak or damaged, the cell bursts (osmotic lysis).]
[Figure: (e) Hypertonic solution. Water moves out of the cell, causing its cytoplasm to shrink (plasmolysis).]

Text: "The drawing below and the micrograph at right show a bacterium sectioned lengthwise to reveal the internal composition. Not all bacteria have all the structures shown; only structures labeled in red are found in all bacteria."
"Although the nucleoid appears split in the photomicrograph, the thinness of the 'slice' does not convey the object's depth."]
