## Slide 4: Malaria Life Cycle
- Fertilization occurs in mosquito stomach
- Migrates to salivary glands.

*Handwritten: Underlines and arrows on key terms*

**Figure: Complete malaria life cycle diagram showing:**
1. Infected mosquito bites human; sporozoites migrate through bloodstream to liver of human.
2. Sporozoites undergo schizogony in liver cell; merozoites are produced.
3. Merozoites released into bloodstream from liver may infect new red blood cells.
4. Merozoite develops into ring stage in red blood cell.
5. Ring stage grows and divides, producing merozoites.
6. Merozoites are released when red blood cell ruptures; some merozoites infect new red blood cells, and some develop into male and female gametocytes.
7. Another mosquito bites infected human and ingests gametocytes.
8. In mosquito's digestive tract, gametocytes unite to form zygote.
9. Resulting sporozoites migrate to salivary glands of mosquito.
