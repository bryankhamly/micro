## Slide 4: What is a virus?
- Virus = poison
- Known to infect every type of cell
- Bacteria, animal, plant, fungi, protozoa
- Are they alive?
- Infectious particles (not organisms)
- Active or inactive (not alive or dead)
- Obligate intracellular parasite
  - Cannot multiple unless it invades host cell.

## Slide 5: HIV: Pathogenesis
- Active Infection
  - Expression of viral DNA; proteins
- Assembly
  - Protease
    - Cleaves large polypeptide to release capsid and RT
    - Important for final assembly/activation of virion
- Release
  - Mature virus leaves by budding (does not immediately kill cell)
  - Acquires envelope and GP spikes.

## Slide 6: Viral Structure
- Virion
  - Complete, fully developed, infectious particle
- Composed of and classified by
  - Nucleic acid
    - DNA or RNA
    - ss or ds
  - Protein coat.

*Handwritten: Underlines on key terms, boxes around labels*

## Slide 7: HIV: Origins
- Identified in 1983
- Mutation of virus endemic to Central African wildlife?
  - SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus)
- Virus jumped to humans when chimps were butchered for food.

## Slide 8: HAART
- Highly active anti-retroviral therapy
- Cocktails
  - Combination of multiple drugs.

*Handwritten: Underlines on key terms*

## Slide 9: Host Range
- Viruses infect specific types of cells
  - Bateriophage
- Determined by virus's specific attachment to cell
  - Cell surface receptor.

## Slide 10: Treatment
- There is no cure for HIV/AIDS
- Current therapies slow progression, diminish symptoms
- Reverse transcriptase inhibitors
  - Synthetic nucleoside analogs
    - Azidothymidine (AZT), Epivir (3TC)
    - Terminates viral replication.

*Handwritten: Underlines on key terms, nucleotide structure drawing*

## Slide 11: HIV: Pathogenesis
- Attachment
  - Infects and destroys CD4+ T helper cells.

*Handwritten: Underlines on key terms, "HIV" label*

## Slide 12: Viral Size
- The smallest of the infectious particles.

*Handwritten: Boxes around various particles*

**Figure: Size comparison showing Human red blood cell (10,000 nm), E. coli (3000 x 1000 nm), various viruses including Ebola (970 nm), Rabies (170 x 70 nm), Bacteriophage T4 (225 nm), Adenovirus (90 nm), Rhinovirus (30 nm), Poliovirus (30 nm), Prion (200 x 20 nm)**

## Slide 13: Latent vs Persistent Viral Infections
- Persistent infection
  - Disease occurs gradually over long period
  - Detectable infectious virus gradually builds up
    - HIV
    - HPV.

*Handwritten: Underlines on key terms, arrows pointing to graph features*

## Slide 14: Viruses and target cells
- Viruses have specific receptors to interact with host cell
- Nervous system
  - Polio, rabies

## Slide 15: Animal Viruses
- Entry
  - Many viruses enter by receptor mediated endocytosis
    - Forming vesicles
  - Enveloped viruses
    - Enter by fusion
    - Viral envelope fuses to plasma membrane
