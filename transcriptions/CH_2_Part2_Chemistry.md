### Slide 1: Many Biomolecules are Polymers

- Polymers
  - Chains of smaller monomers (similar building blocks)

- Joining of monomers usually releases H₂O (dehydration)

- Breaking polymers involves hydrolysis.

[Table: Macromolecules
| Category | Example | Subunit(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Lipids | Fat | Glycerol and fatty acids |
| Carbohydrates* | Polysaccharide | Monosaccharide |
| Proteins* | Polypeptide | Amino acid |
| Nucleic acids* | DNA, RNA | Nucleotide |
*Polymers]

### Slide 2: (Tertiary Structure Bonds)

- Salt bridges
  - Ionic bonds

### Slide 8: Acids and Bases

- Acids
  - Dissociate in water
  - Releases H⁺
  - HCl → H⁺ + Cl⁻ (strong acid)

- Bases
  - Dissociate in water
  - Releases OH⁻ or accepts H⁺
  - NaOH → Na⁺ + OH⁻ (strong base).

[Figure: pH scale 0-14 showing:
- Acidic solution (Increasingly ACIDIC)
- Neutral solution NEUTRAL [H⁺] = [OH⁻]
- Basic solution (Increasingly BASIC)
With examples: 0-Stomach acid, 1-Lemon juice, 2-Grapefruit juice, 3-Wine, 4-Tomato juice, 5, 6-Urine/Milk, 7-Pure water/Human blood, 8-Seawater, 9, 10-Milk of magnesia, 11-Household ammonia, 12-Household bleach, 13-Oven cleaner, 14-Limewater]

### Slide 9: (Protein Interactions)

- Hydrophobic interactions
  - Occur between two nonpolar side chains
  - Usually in interior of protein

- Hydrophilic interaction
  - Attraction between aqueous environment
  - And amino acids with polar/ionized side chains.

### Slide 12: Ionic Bonds

- Ions form when there is a transfer of e⁻
- Na has 1e⁻ in outer shell
- Cl has 7e⁻ in outer shell
- e⁻ transfer results in charge imbalance

- Cations
  - Positively charged ions
- Anions
  - Negatively charged ions
- Attraction between oppositely charged ions
  - Ionic bond.
