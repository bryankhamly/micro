# Chapter 9: Biotechnology and DNA Technology

## Slide 1: DNA Chips
*Handwritten: "Sample" with arrow*

**Figure showing DNA chip/microarray process:**

(a) A DNA chip can be manufactured to contain hundreds of thousands of synthetic single-stranded DNA sequences. Assume that each DNA sequence was unique to a different gene.

(b) Unknown DNA from a sample is separated into single strands, enzymatically cut, and labeled with a fluorescent dye.

(c) The unknown DNA is inserted into the chip and allowed to hybridize with the DNA on the chip.

(d) The tagged DNA will bind only to the complementary DNA on the chip. The bound DNA will be detected by its fluorescent dye and analyzed by a computer. In this *Salmonella* antimicrobial resistance gene microarray, *S. typhimurium*-specific antibiotic resistance gene probes are green, *S. typhi*-specific resistance gene probes are red, and antibiotic-resistance genes found in both serovars appear yellow/orange.

**Image: DNA microarray with colored spots showing hybridization results**

## Slide 2: Figure 9.2 The role of a restriction enzyme in making recombinant DNA.

1. Restriction enzyme cuts (red arrows) double-stranded DNA at its particular recognition sites, shown in blue.
   - DNA with Recognition sites: GAATTC / CTTAAG → Cut → Cut

2. These cuts produce a DNA fragment with two sticky ends.
   - DNA from another source, perhaps a plasmid, cut with the same restriction enzyme.
   - Shows: AATTC ... G / G ... CTTAA with Sticky end

3. When two such fragments of DNA cut by the same restriction enzyme come together, they can join by base pairing.

4. The joined fragments will usually form either a linear molecule or a circular one, as shown here for a plasmid. Other combinations of fragments can also occur.

5. The enzyme DNA ligase is used to unite the backbones of the two DNA fragments, producing a molecule of recombinant DNA.

*Handwritten: "bact. cell" label, arrows showing circular plasmid formation*

## Slide 3: Vectors

- Foreign DNA insertion
- Complementary sticky ends of DNA anneal
- Recombinant phage chromosome is then packaged into a protein coat

## Slide 4: Figure 9.1 A Typical Genetic Modification Procedure.

**Flowchart showing:**
1. bacterium with Plasmid and Bacterial chromosome
2. Vector, such as a plasmid, is isolated.
3. DNA containing gene of interest from a different species is cleaved by an enzyme into fragments. → DNA containing gene of interest
4. Desired gene is selected and inserted into plasmid. → recombinant DNA (plasmid)
5. Plasmid is taken up by a cell, such as a bacterium. → transformed bacterium
6. Cells with gene of interest are cloned with either of two goals in mind.

**Two pathways:**
- Create and harvest copies of a gene.
- OR Create and harvest protein products of a gene. (Plasmid → RNA → Protein product)

**Applications shown:**
- Gene encoding protein for pest resistance is inserted into plant cells. (corn image)
- Gene encoding degradative enzyme to clean up toxic waste is inserted into bacterial cells. (oil spill image)
- Amylase, cellulase, and other enzymes prepare fabrics for clothing manufacture. (fabric image)
- Human growth hormone treats stunted growth. (doctor with child image)

## Slide 7: Figure 9.4 The polymerase chain reaction.

*Handwritten: "3 Steps in 1 cycle"*

**First cycle:**
1. Incubate target DNA at 94°C for 1 minute to separate the strands.
2. Add primers, nucleotides (deoxynucleotides, dNTP), and DNA polymerase.
3. Primers attach to single-stranded DNA during incubation at 60°C for 1 minute.
4. Incubate at 72°C for 1 minute; DNA polymerase copies the target DNA at this temperature.

**Second cycle:**
5. Repeat the cycle of heating and cooling to make two more copies of target DNA.
