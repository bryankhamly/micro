### Slide 1: Two Types of Cells

- Prokaryotic
- Eukaryotic.

### Slide 2: First Recorded Observations of Microbes

- Robert Hooke (1665)
- Cork
- "Cells".

[Figure: Cork wine stoppers and microscopic view of cork cells]

---

### Slide 3: Francois Redi's Experiment 1668

- Observation: Raw meat attracts flies and later maggots
- Question: What causes maggots on rotting meat?
- Hypothesis: Maggots form only when flies are present
- Experiment/Test: Place meat in sealed and unsealed jars
- Result: Only meat in open jars produced maggots
- Conclusion: Hypothesis supported
  - (no spontaneous generation!).

[Figure: Image of maggots on meat]

### Slide 4: Louis Pasteur

- Microbes can be present in nonliving matter
  - But do not spontaneously arise
- Air
- Liquids
- Can be destroyed by heat
  - Aseptic technique.

[Figure: Portrait of Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) - Demonstrated that life did not arise spontaneously from nonliving matter.]

---

### Slide 5: Archaea

- Prokaryotic
- Cell walls
  - Lack peptidoglycan
- Live in extreme environments
  - Methanogens
  - Extreme halophiles
  - Extreme thermophiles.

### Slide 6: Louis Pasteur v. Spontaneous Generation

1. Pasteur first poured beef broth into a long-necked flask.
   - Microorganisms were present in the broth.

2. Next he heated the neck of the flask and bent it into an S-shape; then he boiled the broth for several minutes.
   - Microorganisms were not present in the broth after boiling.

3. Microorganisms did not appear in the cooled solution, even after long periods.
   - Bend prevented microbes from entering the flask.
   - Microorganisms were not present even after long periods.

### Slide 7: Nomenclature

- System established by Carolus Linnaeus (1735)
- Binomial (scientific name)
  - Genus
  - Specific epithet (species name)
    - *Escherichia coli*

[Figure: Taxonomic hierarchy showing Domain (Domains), Kingdom (Kingdoms), Phylum (Phyla), Class (Classes), Order (Orders), Family (Families), Genus (Genera), Species (Species)]

### Slide 8: Fungi

- Domain Eukarya
- Cell walls
  - Chitin
- Unicellular
- Multicellular
- Absorb nutrients from environment.

---

### Slide 9: What is microbiology?

- Study of living things too small to see without magnification
- Bacteria
- Fungi
- Protozoa
- Algae
- Helminths
- Viruses.

[Figure: Dr. Evil from Austin Powers movie, various microscope images of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, algae, protozoa, and helminths]

---

### Slide 10: Helminths

- Domain Eukarya
- Kingdom Animalia
- Multicellular
- Parasitic worms
  - Flatworms
  - Roundworms.

[Figure: Images of various parasitic worms - flatworm, roundworm, and microscopic eggs]

### Slide 11: Spontaneous Generation vs Biogenesis

- Spontaneous generation
  - Life could arise from nonliving matter
    - Soil
    - Bad air

- Biogenesis
  - Life arises only from living organisms
  - which may be too small to see.

[Figure: Plants vs Zombies game characters]

### Slide 12: What about disease?

- Robert Koch
- German physician
- Studied anthrax
  - In diseased cattle
- Develops Koch's Postulates about disease
  - Sequence of experimental steps
  - Directly relating specific microbe
  - To specific disease.

### Slide 13: Tree of Life

- Three Domains
  - Bacteria
  - Archaea
  - Eukarya.

[Figure: Venn diagram showing three domains - BACTERIA (cyanobacteria, heterotrophic bacteria), ARCHAEA (halophiles, thermophiles), and EUKARYOTA (chromists, plants, animals, fungi, alveolates, rhodophytes, flagellates, basal protists)]

[Figure: Phylogenetic tree showing Domain Bacteria (Endospore producers, Chlamydias, Gram-positive bacteria, Blue-green bacteria, Rickettsias), Domain Archaea (Methane producers, Procaryotes that live in extreme salt, Procaryotes that live in extreme heat), and Domain Eukarya (Eucaryotes) with branches for Plants, Animals, Fungi, and Protists]

---

### Slide 14: Algae

- Domain Eukarya
- Photosynthetic
- Unicellular
- Cell walls
  - Cellulose
- Live in salt water, soil, or in association with plants.

[Figure: Microscope image of Volvox colonies (50 μm scale) and cartoon algae monster]

### Slide 15: Protozoa

- Domain Eukarya
- Unicellular
- Free living or parasitic
- Classified based on movement
  - Pseudopodia
  - Cilia
  - Flagella.

[Figure: Microscope images of various protozoa including Giardia, amoeba, and ciliated protozoan]

---

### Slide 16: Viruses

- Non living agents
- Acellular
- Require host cell for reproduction
  - Obligate intracellular parasites
- Simple structures:
  - Nucleic acid:
    - DNA or RNA
  - Protein coat.

[Figure: Images of Influenza virus (green), Ebola virus, and coronavirus]

### Slide 17: First Recorded Observations of Microbes

- Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723)
- First to observe live microorganisms
  - Using magnifying lenses
- "Animalcules".

[Figure: (a) Van Leeuwenhoek using his microscope - painting of man at window]

[Figure: Historical illustration of woman with early microscope and circular diagram showing various "animalcules" observed]

---

### Slide 18: Bacteria

- Prokaryotic
- Simple shapes
  - Bacillus (rods)
  - Coccus (spheres)
  - Spirillum (spiral)
- Cell walls
  - Peptidoglycan.

[Figure: SEM image of bacteria showing rod and coccus shapes]

---

### Slide 19: Louis Pasteur v. Spontaneous Generation

- Demonstrates that microbes are present in air (1861).

[Figure: Diagram showing two experimental conditions:
Top row: Broth heated → Cool → Flask left open → Wait → Growth
Bottom row: Broth heated → Flask sealed → Wait → No growth → Open flask → Growth]

### Slide 20: Eukaryotic Cells

- Have membrane bound organelles; compartmentalized
  - Has nucleus
- "eukaryotic" = true nucleus
- Much larger, more complex than prokaryotes
- Have multiple, linear chromosomes
- Single celled, or multicellular organisms.

[Figure: ANIMAL CELL diagram showing Nucleus, Nucleolus, Mitochondrion, Cytoskeleton, Ribosomes, Golgi apparatus, Centrioles, Smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Peroxisome, Plasma membrane, Rough endoplasmic reticulum]

---

### Slide 21: Prokaryotic Cells

- Lacks membrane bound organelles
  - Lacks a nucleus
- "prokaryote" = before the nucleus
- Small, simple cells
- Single, circular chromosome.

[Handwritten note: human cells = 46 somatic]
