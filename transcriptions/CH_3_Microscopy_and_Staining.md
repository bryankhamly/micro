### Slide 1: Acidic Dyes

- The chromophore is in negative ion
- Eosin
- Nigrosin
- Congo Red
- Heat fixing not required
- Used if cells are too delicate to withstand heat fixing
- Minimizes distortion of cell size and shape.

### Slide 2: Units of Measurement

- But microbes are really small!
- Micrometer
- 1 μm = 10⁻⁶ m = 10⁻³ mm

- Nanometer
- 1 nm = 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁻⁶ mm.

---

### Slide 3: Units of Measurement

- The metric system
- A decimal system based on 10
- Used in most of the world
- Used in all science classes.

### Slide 4: Gram positive vs. Gram negative

- Gram positive
  - Cell wall has thick peptidoglycan layer
- Gram negative
  - Cell wall has thinner peptidoglycan layer
  - and higher lipid content.

### Slide 5: Length

- The metric unit of length
- Is the meter (m).

[Figure: Meterstick (10-100 cm, 1 meter = 39.4 inches)]

### Slide 6: Gram Stain Procedure

- Smear
- Heat fix
- Crystal Violet
- Water rinse
- Iodine (mordant)
  - CV-I complex
- Water rinse
- Decolorize (acetone/alcohol)
  - 3-5 seconds!
  - Rinse immediately
- Counterstain (safranin)
- Water rinse
- Oil immersion.

[Figure: Diagram showing Gram negative vs Gram positive staining process:
- Cells are transparent prior to staining
- Crystal violet stains Gram-positive and Gram-negative cells. Iodine is used as a mordant.
- Decolorization with alcohol or acetone removes crystal violet from Gram-negative cells.
- Safranin is used to counterstain Gram-negative cells.]

### Slide 7: Gram Stain

- 1884
- Hans Christian Gram
- Important staining procedure
- Gram positive cells vs. gram negative cells
- Based on cell wall composition.

### Slide 8: Differential Stains

- Used to distinguish between different kinds of bacteria
- Gram Stain
- Acid-Fast Stain.

---

### Slide 9: Basic Dyes

- The chromophore is in positive ion

- Crystal violet
- Methylene blue
- Malachite green
- Safranin.

### Slide 10: Acid-Fast Stain

- Heat fixed smear
- Add carbolfuchsin
- Steam
- Rinse
- Decolorize (acid-alcohol)
- Rinse
- Counterstain: methylene blue
- Rinse

[Figure: Diagram showing Acid-Fast vs Nonacid-Fast staining process:
- Cells prior to staining are transparent.
- After staining with carbolfuchsin, cells are reddish-purple. Steam heat enhances the entry of carbolfuchsin into cells.
- Decolorization with acid alcohol removes stain from acid-fast negative cells.
- Methylene blue is used to counterstain acid-fast negative cells.]

### Slide 11: Compound Light Microscope

- Has series of lenses
- Objective lens
  - 10x (low power)
  - 40x (high power)
  - 100x (oil immersion)
- Ocular lens
  - Usually 10x.

[Figure: (a) Principal parts and functions of microscope:
- *Ocular lens (eyepiece)* Remagnifies the image formed by the objective lens
- *Fine focusing knob*
- *Coarse focusing knob*
- *Body tube* Transmits the image from the objective lens to the ocular lens
- *Arm*
- *Objective lenses* Primary lenses that magnify the specimen
- *Stage* Holds the microscope slide in position
- *Condenser* Focuses light through specimen
- *Diaphragm* Controls the amount of light entering the condenser
- *Illuminator* Light source
- *Base*]

### Slide 12: Acid-Fast Stain

- Special dye (carbolfuchsin) binds waxy material (mycolic acid)
  - In certain cell walls
- *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
- *Mycobacterium leprae*.

[Figure: Hands affected by leprosy]

---

### Slide 13: Simple Stains

- Uses one basic dye
- Highlights the entire microbe
- So shapes and structures visible
- Mordant
  - Chemical added to intensify stain.

[Figure: Microscope image of staphylococcus bacteria stained with simple stain]

---

### Slide 14: Preparation of Specimens

- Staining
  - Adding a dye
  - Emphasizes certain structures
- Fixing
  - Kills cells
  - Attaches cells to slide
  - Bunsen burner.
